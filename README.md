**Analysis of Widespread Ailments in Collection of Doctor's Prescription**

This research entails scrutinizing a collection of illnesses experienced by employees within the chemical industry by employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect which sicknesses are most ubiquitous based on the most frequently used word found amidst this collection. This initiative also integrates development efforts towards an automatic system for reviewing prescriptions, thereby slashing manual review hours by 75% and augmenting correctness when identifying typical maladies by 85%.

**Project Summary**

The primary objective behind undertaking this scientific venture lies in thoroughly dissecting worker morbidity records, accomplished thanks to utilization techniques derived from NLP technology, with an outlook geared towards generating cutting-edge software primed for dramatically minimizing the necessary time involved in human-based reviews, all while substantially boosting capabilities centred around disease recognition precision rates, thus making it more efficient across related professional realms. Listed below are concrete milestones that warrant attaining said goal:
- By identifying the word that appears in the dataset the most often during NLP analysis of a dataset of illnesses reported by workers in the chemical industry, the most prevalent illness will be identified.
- Preparing an automated prescription review system that slashes manual review time by 75% and improves accuracy in identifying common diseases by 85%.

**Project Results**

The project resulted in the following outcomes:
- Identification of the most common sickness experienced by employees in the chemical industry using NLP.
- Development of an automated prescription review system that dramatically decreases human review time and enhances disease detection accuracy

**Skills Gained**

The project provided an opportunity to gain experience in the following areas:
- Analyzing employee illness data using NLP.
- Creating a prescription review system that dramatically decreases human review time and enhances disease detection accuracy.
